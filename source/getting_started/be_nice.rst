It is important to nice intensive processes so that they donâ€™t interfere with using the most basic functions of the research server such as changing directories or moving files.

The nice and renice commands adjust the priority of a process. ARC recommends that all users nice all of their processes with a value of at least 5. To nice a process when it is started type:

$ nice +5 [other_commands]


where [other_commands] is the command you actually wan to run. If you have already started a job and want to nice it after the fact, you can use the renice command to do this. First identify the process ID that you wish to nice:

$ ps -u


Then run renice on it:

$ renice +5 [PID]


where [PID] is the process ID.
