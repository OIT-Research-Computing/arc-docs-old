ARC aims to supply robust up-to-date versions of GCC.

Currently we support the lastest release of every major version of GCC. If there is a version of GCC that isn't supported that you need please let us know and we'll get to building it for you.

GCC on compute servers (Circe/Hecate):
======================================

All versions of GCC can be found under:

.. code-block:: sh

    /vol/apps/gcc/

Versions Currenty Supported:
----------------------------

* 4.4.7 (system)
* 4.6.4 
* 4.7.4
* 4.8.5
* 4.9.3
* 5.1.0
* 5.2.0
* 5.3.0
* 6.1.0

Languages Currently Supported:
------------------------------

* C
* C++
* Objective C
* Objective C++
* Fortran

.. note:: GCC on the compute servers does not support 32 bit 
    
GCC on Clusters (Hydra/Deino):
==============================

We are currently working on building GCC on the clusters.

GCC has been built up to 4.9.3 on Deino.

Versions Currenty Supported:
----------------------------

* 4.4.7 (system)
* 4.6.4 
* 4.7.4
* 4.8.5
* 4.9.3

Languages Currently Supported:
------------------------------

* C
* C++
* Objective C
* Objective C++
* Fortran


.. note:: Newer GCC builds are not yet available on Hydra

Using non-system GCC
====================

Using a non-system GCC is done serveral different ways depending on your use-case. This document will cover two common scenarios you might encounter.

Compiling a single file:
------------------------

First, set your ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` to include the libraries of gcc build you want to use (This configuration will change when you log out or change shells). Depending on what you are doing, this step might not be necessary.

.. code-block:: sh

    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/vol/apps/gcc/gcc-6.1.0/lib:/vol/apps/gcc/gcc-6.1.0/lib64

After your library path is set, compile your file using the full path to the non-system gcc compiler.

.. code-block:: sh

    /vol/apps/gcc/gcc-6.1.0/bin/gcc myfile.c


Compiling a program with make:
------------------------------

The process of using a non-system gcc to compile software with ``make`` differs between programs. Generally ``make`` will look for environment vairables durring the ``configure`` step that tell ``make`` which compiler and libraries to build the program with. To get a list of significant environment vairables run the following command inside the programs base directory.

.. code-block:: sh

    ./configure --help

Some typical enviroment vairables for setting compiler paths include:

.. code-block:: sh

    CC  -- C compiler (gcc)
    CXX -- C++ compiler (g++)
    FC  -- Fortran compiler (gfortran)
    F77 -- Fortran 77 compiler (typically gfortran)

Before configuring your software set the nesseary compiler environment variables and your library path variable in your current shell.

.. code-block:: sh

    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/vol/apps/gcc/gcc-6.1.0/lib:/vol/apps/gcc/gcc-6.1.0/lib64
    export CC=/vol/apps/gcc/gcc-6.1.0/bin/gcc

    ./configure
    make
    make install


.. note:: The LD_LIBRARY_PATH variable doesn't always need to be set. Consult ./configure --help for more infomation
